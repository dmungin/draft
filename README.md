# Fantasy Football Drafting Tool

*This application is currently in development*

The primary focus of the app is:

1. Scrape a website for player information - Name, Team, Position, Ranking, ADP, etc...
2. Manage the drafting process for one to many leagues by taking the player information and allowing users to:
	* Assign keepers
	* Live draft by picking players from the list
	* View draft results
